    title: "7 JavaScript Concepts That Every Web Developer Should Know",
    intro:
      "fulfills JavaScript is Everywhere. Millions of web pages are built on JavaScript and it’s not going anywhere at least for now. On one side HTML and CSS give styling to the web pages but on the other side, it’s the magic of JavaScript that makes your web page alive. Today this language is not just limited to your web browser. You can also use it for server-side applications. Isn’t it cool to use a single language for both client-side and server-side applications? A single language fulfills both of the purposes and this is the main reason TONs of job postings is there for JavaScript developers in the tech industry. According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, JavaScript is the #1 programming language. The language is widely used by 95% of all websites Whether it’s a small startup or a big company, most of them are working on some kind of website or an app that requires a good knowledge of this language. A lot of frameworks and libraries are there for JavaScript. These frameworks and libraries can be easily learned if your JavaScript fundamentals are clear. A lot of concepts are confusing and overwhelming for developers but a good knowledge of these concepts will help you in the long run. Frameworks and libraries come and go but the fundamentals always remain the same. It’s easy to build any kind of application and learn any framework and libraries if the fundamentals are clear. Also, it will help you in interviews as well. Let’s discuss some of the basic concepts of javascript which are important to learn for any JavaScript developer. Become a good front-end developer with Geeksforgeeks JavaScript Foundation – Self-Paced and learn all the aspects of web development with ease. These are the 7 concepts:",
    content: [
      {
        title: "1. Scope",
        info: "Scope means variable access. What variable do I have access to when a code is running? In JavaScript by default, you’re always in the root scope i.e. the window scope. The scope is simply a box with a boundary for variables, functions, and objects. These boundaries put restrictions on variables and determine whether you have access to the variable or not. It limits the visibility or availability of a variable to the other parts of the code. You must have a clear understanding of this concept because it helps you to separate logic in your code and also improves readability. A scope can be defined in three ways – Local Scope allows access to everything within the boundaries (inside the box) Global Scope is everything outside the boundaries (outside the box). A global scope can not access a variable defined in the local scope because it is enclosed from the outer world, except if you return it. Block Scope is everything inside the boundaries but it works only for let and const keywords. It does not work with the var keyword. ",
      },
      {
        title: "2. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)",
        info: "As the name suggests IIFE is a function in JavaScript which immediately invoked and executed as soon as it is defined. Variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world and this way you can avoid the global scope from getting polluted. So the primary reason to use IIFE is to immediately execute the code and obtain data privacy. ",
      },
      {
        title: "3. Hoisting",
        info: "A lot of developers get unexpected results when they are not clear about the concept of hoisting in JavaScript. In Javascript, you can call a function before it is defined and you won’t get an error ‘Uncaught ReferenceError’. The reason behind this is hoisting where the Javascript interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current scope (function scope or global scope) before the code execution.",
      },
      {
        title: "4. Closures",
        info: "A closure is simply a function inside another function that has access to the outer function variable. Now, this definition sounds pretty much straightforward but the real magic is created with the scope. The inner function (closure) can access the variable defined in its scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), in the scope of its parent function, and in the global variables. Now here you need to remember that the outer function can not have access to the inner function variable (we have already discussed this in the scope concept). Let’s take an example and understand it in a better way. ",
      },
      {
        title: "5. Callbacks",
        info: "In JavaScript, a callback is simply a function that is passed to another function as a parameter and is invoked or executed inside the other function. Here a function needs to wait for another function to execute or return a value and this makes the chain of the functionalities (when X is completed, then Y is executed, and it goes on.). This is the reason callback is generally used in the asynchronous operation of JavaScript to provide the synchronous capability. ",
      },
      {
        title: "6. Promises",
        info: "We understand the concept of callback but what will happen if your code will have callbacks within callbacks within callbacks and it goes on? Well, this recursive structure of callback is called ‘callback hell’ and promises to help to solve this kind of issue. Promises are useful in asynchronous JavaScript operations when we need to execute two or more back-to-back operations (or chaining callback), where each subsequent function starts when the previous one is completed. A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future, either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved (rejected). According to the developer.Mozilla “A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.”. Promises resolve the issue of ‘callback hell’ which is nothing but a recursive structure of callbacks (callbacks within callbacks within callbacks and so forth). A promise may be in three possible states… Fulfilled: When the operation is completed successfully.Rejected: When the operation is failed.Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.",
      },
      {
        title: "7. Async & Await",
        info: "Stop and wait until something is resolved. Async & await is just syntactic sugar on top of Promises and like promises it also provides a way to maintain asynchronous operation more synchronously. So in JavaScript asynchronous operations can be handled in various versions… ES5 -> CallbackES6 -> PromiseES7 -> async & awaitYou can use Async/Await to perform the Rest API request where you want the data to fully load before pushing it to the view. For Nodejs and browser programmers async/await is a great syntactic improvement. It helps the developer to implement functional programming in javascript and it also increases the code readability.

        title: "1. Components and Props",
